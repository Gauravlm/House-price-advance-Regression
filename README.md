# Introduction
The Ames Housing Dataset, which itself contains 1460 observations in both training and tests sets, and 80 features to boot. The challenge is to predict property Sale Price, hence this is a Regression problem.

Throughout this kernel I will provide explanations about my code so you can understand the logic behind each action. While i'll conduct some feature engineering, my main focus will be to explore the predictive models and hopefully build an effective stacked model for final prediction.
